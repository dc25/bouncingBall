# mousePosInElement

This is a Reflex (Haskell/ghcjs/FRP) example.  If you don't know that that means then this particular example is probably of no interest to you.

In Reflex, to get the mouse position relative to an element you will need to use wrapDomElement.  This example/demo shows how to do that.

In the demo the element happens to be an svg element but that's not necessary.

To see a running sample, follow this link: http://dc25.github.io/mousePosInElement/ and move the mouse over the rectangle that you see on the screen.  The coordinates of the mouse relative to the rectangle should appear below the rectangle.
